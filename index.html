                    Aspiring full stack developer from St. Louis Missouri, but have I lived in Texas, South Carolina,
                    South Korea, and Qatar. When not studying development, I am either in my home studio working on
                    music or playing in one of many soccer leagues.

                <h3>Technical Background</h3>

                <p>
                    USAF veteran with BSc in Computer Science, emphasis in Cyber Security. During university, topics
                    covered programming and data structures in C++, databases using oracle, front end development with
                    HTML and CSS, and mobile app development using objective C.<br><br>
                    After university, I persued a network security path and got a job within the DoD maintaining network
                    operations, which then led to
                    a position maintaining security within the network. Both of these positions allowed me to work with
                    security devices and software as well as utilize my certifications in security and ethical
                    hacking.<br><br>
                    At this time of my professionl career, I have decided to transfer back into where my original
                    passions lie and join a coding camp in order to refresh my knowledge of full stack development, see
                    what is current in the industry, and prepare myself for what is ahead.
